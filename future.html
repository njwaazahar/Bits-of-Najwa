<div style="border: 5px solid #65655E; padding:10px; background-color:#DDC3D0;">
<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>It's a bit awkward to write this type of  letter, but I hope this letter finds you in a peaceful moment — maybe with your favorite matcha latte in hand, maybe sitting somewhere quiet, or maybe in the middle of a busy day where you just needed to pause. Either way, I’m glad you’re here, still showing up.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>Right now, as I write this, life feels like a mix of uncertainty and hope. Some days are clear skies, and others feel like storms I don’t know how to get through. But I keep going — and I hope you’re proud of that. I hope you haven’t forgotten how strong we had to be just to get to this point.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>I wonder where you are now. Did you finally take that Japan trip you kept daydreaming about? Did you chase the career you love, or discover something entirely new that set your soul on fire? Are you still surrounding yourself with people who make you laugh until your stomach hurts? I hope so. I really hope so.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>But more than achievements or milestones, I hope you’ve learned to enjoy the quiet moments — the ones that don’t make it to Instagram, but stay in your heart. Like late-night talks, me time with books, messy rooms filled with creativity, and the comforting presence of someone who understands you without needing many words.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>Please don’t forget how far you've come. All the nights you cried, all the days you didn’t give up, all the times you kept going when you had every reason to stop — they mattered. They still matter. I hope you’ve learned to be kind to yourself, to rest without guilt, and to stop shrinking yourself for people who don’t see your worth.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>If you feel stuck or unsure right now, take a deep breath. It’s okay to pause. It’s okay not to have all the answers. You never needed to be perfect — only real.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>Most of all, I hope you’re still curious, still soft, still growing — even if it’s slowly. Life doesn’t have to be loud to be meaningful.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>Wherever you are, whoever you're with, I hope you’re safe. I hope you’re proud. And I hope you remember that you are loved — not for what you do, but for who you are.</em></p>


<br>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"><em>With all my heart,

<br>Me (from the past, rooting for you always)</em></p>
